## App Description:

- This app is a simple to-do list manager implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Add To-Do Items: Users can enter new to-do items into an input field and submit them. The items are then displayed in a list.

- Mark as Completed: Users can click on a to-do item to mark it as completed. Completed items are visually distinguished.

- Remove To-Do Items: Each to-do item has a "Remove" button that allows users to delete the item from the list.

- The app provides a basic interface for managing a to-do list and demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to add, mark, and remove items.
